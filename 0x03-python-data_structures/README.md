 data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data. Two of the most basic and useful data structures in Python are lists and tuples.

 Lists are ordered collections of items, and each item can be of a different data type. Lists are mutable, meaning they can be modified after they are created. Lists are created using square brackets, and the items are separated by commas.

 Tuples are also ordered collections of items, but they are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified after they are created. Tuples are created using parentheses, and the items are separated by commas.
