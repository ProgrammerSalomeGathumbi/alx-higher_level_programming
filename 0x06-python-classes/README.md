Python - Classes and Objects
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects (also known as instances). It defines the properties and methods that all instances of that class will have.
An object is an instance of a class and can be manipulated using the properties and methods defined in that class. An instance is another term for an object.
The difference between a class and an object/instance is that a class is a template or blueprint for creating objects, while an object is an actual instance of a class that has been created.
