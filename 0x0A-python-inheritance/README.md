 Python - Inheritance  
Superclass, base class or parent class refers to a class that is a parent of another class in an inheritance hierarchy, and provides a basic structure or common attributes and behaviors that can be inherited by its subclasses.

Subclass is a class that inherits attributes and methods from a parent class and can add its own attributes and methods.

To list all attributes and methods of a class or instance in Python, you can use the built-in dir() function. For example, dir(object) or dir(instance) will return a list of all attributes and methods of the class or instance, respectively.

An instance can have new attributes at any time by simply assigning a value to a new attribute. For example, instance.new_attribute = value will add a new attribute to the instance.
