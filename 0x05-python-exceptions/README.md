An exception is a circumstance that arises while a program is being executed and prevents the instructions from proceeding normally. When an exception occurs, an object called an exception is created that contains details about the error, such as what kind of error it was and where in the code it took place. Try-except blocks can be used to manage exceptions and respond appropriately when one arises.
