Python - More Classes and Objects
Public attributes can be accessed from anywhere, protected attributes can be accessed within the class and its subclasses, and private attributes are only accessible within the class.
The "self" keyword refers to the instance of the class that is currently being manipulated.
A method is a function that is associated with an object or class.
The special init method is called automatically when an object is created and can be used to set initial values for attributes.
The special str and repr methods are used to define how an object should be represented as a string (for the user) and as a string that can be used to recreate the object (for developers), respectively.
The str method should return a human-readable string representation of the object, while repr should return a string that can be used to recreate the object.
