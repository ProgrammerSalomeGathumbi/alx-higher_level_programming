 python test driven development
Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development methodology in which tests are written before the actual code is written. In Python, this process typically involves the following steps:

Write test cases: The developer writes test cases that describe the desired behavior of the code they are about to write. These test cases are written using a library such as unittest or pytest.

Run the tests: The developer runs the test cases, which should all fail because the actual code has not been written yet.

Write the code: The developer writes the code that is needed to make the test cases pass.

Run the tests again: The developer runs the test cases again to ensure that the code they wrote works as expected.

Refactor the code: The developer refactors the code to improve its design or performance, if necessary.

Repeat the above steps: The developer repeats steps 1-5 for each new feature or bug fix they want to implement.

It is important to note that the process of TDD encourages the developer to write code that is simple, maintainable and with high test coverage.

It also helps the developer to think about the problem they are trying to solve and how to test it, it also helps to catch bugs early and make sure that the codebase is working as expected.
